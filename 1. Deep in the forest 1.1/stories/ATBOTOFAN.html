<h2> Chapter 1 Cru and Band</h2>
  
<p>"Sammy's Adventure Journal, 20 July, 7 years after Orion, entry 2022. For the first time in a while, we are finally sitting together with the Alpha Cru again. Alea and Lennox had quite a lot of work to do with the whole 'rebuilding the ocean world'."</p>

<p>Alea laughed. "That's quite an understatement. But you guys helped too." Alea, Lennox, and Sammy were sitting on the couch inside the Crucis. Ben was sitting on the hammock, Fussel was lying in front of the couch, Niki was getting drinks. "But I could have helped you a lot more! Ok, anyway, we can talk about that when else. I've written down a few questions that people might be interested in. I'd start doing that now, when you're ready."</p>

<p>Niki just came out of the kitchen area. She balanced empty glasses in one arm, water and apple juice in the other. Ben stood up and took three glasses from her. "What do you want to drink?" Niki asked. "Apple juice, please," Alea said, and Lennox took a glass from Ben. "I'm mixing, thank you."</p>

<p>"Now that we're all taken care of," Sammy happily pulled the sheets of paper out of his pocket with his questions, "we can begin. First question, what have you been doing all this time? You don't even hear about you above water anymore."</p>

<p>Lennox replied: "After we finally defeated the virus with Nelani, we naturally had to revive the ocean. People probably heard 'Message for the Ocean World,' the video we uploaded to let the sea children and other merfolk know that they could return to the ocean and waters if they wanted. Next to this, the whole world found out about the merfolk because, well, the whole of humanity saw the video," Lennox didn't like the idea, as so often when it came to the sea world and landwalkers.</p>

<p>Alea took over: "So, after another message, in Hajara this time, all the merpeople met in Rach Turana, and we did a census. Now, of course, you don't just do that, especially with so few old merfolk who still know the times before the virus. The seafolk were a great help. Once we had done that, we divided groups to rebuild the Sea Cities. Unfortunately, there were very few Schai among the survivors. Most seaside cities only have a temporary restoration.</p>

<p>Lennox and I have introduced some new tasks. There are now representatives from every sea tribe. For example, I am the representative for the wanderers, I was elected by all the wanderers who were present at Rach Turana. Merpeople come to me when they have problems with my tribe to solve them peacefully, it takes a lot of travel and therefore time. Lennox travels with me, so we can't be with you very often. We're very sorry."</p>

<p>Sammy felt the uncomfortable tightness in his chest. It's been happening more often lately. He had made a pendant out of things that reminded him of beautiful experiences or adventures. For some time now he held onto it. He pulled it out of his pocket and immediately felt better. Ben, meanwhile, shook his head, "No, no problem, we were able to help a bit. Ever since the Kendarer boy found the mobile aerial bronns in old documents from before the division of the land people and merfolk world, we have been helping to rebuild Suun Amuun."</p>

<p>"Thanks, again," Lennox's gaze turned to Sammy, "Do you want to move on to the next question?" The addressee nodded. "Where are the rest of our gang?" Sammy knew where Tess, Aunt Hildegard and Kit were, but he asked because the Alpha Cru had always traveled around the actual adventure in groups of five, and in earlier episodes that Sammy had put online, they were usually five, later with Kit and Niki they were seven.</p>

<p>"Kit and Tess live in a beach house in the south of France. Kit became the representative of the Brim because she had a lot of experience with the abilities of the Brim and her main task is to train young Brim so that they do not endanger themselves. Tess has been looking for a merperson for a while, preferably a Brim, who would give up his abilities to trade with her. We're on our way to them." Alea grinned. Sammy grinned back and looked at his paper.</p>

<p>"Let's move on to the next question, which ties in surprisingly well with the last statement: What are we doing right now?" Lennox replied again: "We're going on vacation. A week with whales on the way to France. Nelani and Keblarr take care of the whales in the ocean." There was silence. Everyone knew that a family member was missing.</p>

<p>Anthea died in one of the attempts to capture Orion. She had rescued Cassaras and defended him from a Darkoner. She had died like a heroine, defending her best friend.</p>

<p>"The silence is so crushing, we could squeeze apple juice with it." Alea smiled, understanding Sammy's attempt to cheer her up. "We remember Thea as a heroine, like everyone who knows her story. Yes, she saved not only Cassaras, but also the merpeople. Mura would really have been her downfall. Cassaras is a worthy king, and a hard-working one at that. He is helping us with the mermaids and wrakans to rebuild the sea cities." Ben looked at Sammy. He touched the small bow he had made for the Mermaid King.</p>

<p>"Wait a minute, what time is it?" Niki looked at his watch. "Half past one pm. I'd say if you want to perform today, you should hurry." The Alpha Cru had planned to perform in Kiel. Alea's glasses and Lennox's guitar were safely stowed away on the Crucis. Under water, they used other instruments. Sammy jumped to his feet. "Let's go! That's probably the end of today's episode of the adventure diary. " Sammy finished the recording. " Do you think the recording is okay, or do you want me to edit something out?" Alea shook her head. "Everything fits." Sammy packed his phone, jumped up and ran to the boys' cabin. "Let's go. Let's get ready."</p>

<p>A good 20 minutes later, everyone was ready and equipped with instruments or a camera. Niki filmed the performances so that Sammy could upload them later with the adventure diary entry. "Is everyone ready?" Ben looked at them all. "Sammy, you can't stop with the weird outfits, can you?" Although they had rehearsals from time to time, this was their first performance in a long time. With a drum under his arm, he didn't want to take the cajon with him today, he was ready to leave. Sammy wore clothes that you would typically associate with Robin Hood, all in green. He jumped on the deck and shouted, "Never!" Everyone laughed.</p>

<p>The group got off the boat, Ben had a city map with him and was looking for a good place to play. Alea came up with the idea of asking a shop if they could play in front of it. There was probably an ice cream parlour in the center of the town. They first walked in the direction of the town hall square.</p>

<p>A little later they arrived at it and thought about where they could stand. After they finally set everything up, they could start playing.</p>

<p>In the beginning it was a bit lacking, but little by little the melodies came out better and better from their instruments. Some people came and listened to the Alpha Cru.</p>

<p>Since Sammy had started posting videos online on a regular basis, they had formed a small fanbase that made it they mission to find Ben, Niki and Sammy at their performances. There were also some videos featuring the entire Alpha Cru, but for the most part, fans knew through the adventure diary that it was mostly just Sammy and Ben playing music.</p>

<p>Alea and Lennox hadn't forgotten how to wow the audience. After three songs, all playing together, Lennox and Alea sang together alone.</p>

<p>The guitar case was already very full, but still some people threw money into the box. After two more songs, they had to take a break. Niki fetched drinks and sandwiches from her backpack that Ben had prepared.</p>

<p>Alea took a look around the street where they were performing. A clock tower protruded from the rooftops of the city a few streets away, a house with many windows and stone coats of arms and a small shop. "Kiel looks very relaxed. We should come back soon." Sammy laughed. "We'll see when 'soon' is." Lennox shook his head, smiling. "We will come to visit you more often. That's a promise."</p>

<p>Niki looked at three people who were still waiting. "I think you've taken enough of a break." She nodded in the direction in which the people were standing. Ben collected the bottles and lunch boxes and put them back in his backpack. Niki picked up the camera again and the rest of the Alpha Cru went back to their instruments.</p>

<p>Sammy had written a song. Sure, Sammy had written a lot of songs, but he didn't like any more than "Les Amies" When Tess and Kit were still living on the Crucis, Sammy managed to convince Tess to write a song with him. It wasn't a complicated text, only Tess had translated part of the text into French.</p>

<p>It was about Tess's farewell, after the holidays, when she had to go back to France. They push over the best moments that Tess and Sammy and the others had experienced together. Sammy really wanted to have the memories of the animals, Tess the many street performances.</p>

<p>Sammy and Ben sang "Les Amies" today because Tess wasn't there, Sammy would send her and Kit the recordings later. After three more popular songs, they stopped. Sammy was completely exhausted. He gratefully accepted his water bottle from Niki and almost choked because he drank too fast.</p>

<p>The Alpha Cru had started to pack when a girl approached them. She was wearing a short leather jacket and a shoulder bag. Her friends seem to be waiting a little further back. "Hi. Your music sounds really cool. Do you want to go to town with me and some friends?" Sammy looked at Alea and Lennox. "Well, actually, I had already planned something today..." He would like to go to town with the girl, but there was something he didn't like about the situation.</p>

<p>"It's too bad. One of my friends-" Alea pushed her way to them. "Hey. Sammy, are you flirting with one of our fans?" She nudged her elbow lightly into his side. Sammy looked at Alea, slightly annoyed. "Why would I do that? She just asked me if I wanted to hang out with her and her friends."</p>

<p>Alea took the drum from him. "Sure, go with them. We can take your stuff with us." But Sammy didn't want to. "I actually want to spend the day with you," he turned to the girl, "I'm sorry, but I haven't seen my friends for a long time. I hope you understand." The girl nodded. "Here's my number, if you have time." She wrote something down and handed it to Sammy. "See you soon" She waved and ran back to her friends.</p>

<p>"Why did you say that, Sammy? She likes you. We could have come back at a different time." Sammy turned to Alea, "Why do you expect me to like her too Snow White? I mean, she seemed nice, but I just want to spend the day with you. I haven't seen you for so long." Alea looked confused. "This would have been your chance to date a girl. You're 16 now, aren't you? Haven't had anyone you liked yet? Maybe a boy you liked?" Sammy looked up again. "Should I?" Sammy grabbed the pendant in his pocket.</p>

<p>Sammy ran to Ben. "Can we please go back to the Crucis?" "Sure, we've just finished. Everything ok?" Sammy looked away. "Sure, I just miss Fussel."</p>

<h2> Chapter 2 Midnight </h2>
  
<p>Sammy slept very badly. They had been back at 4 p.m. and had been able to bake cookies together. Alea and Lennox had then left at 7 p.m. to return to Nelani and Keblarr. Fussel had laid down in front of Sammy's bed. It had been a nice end to the two days Lennox and Alea had spent on the Crucis.</p>

<p>Sammy sat up and turned on his desk lamp. On the small table next to Sammy's bed was his diary, some collectibles from the Ocean Kingdom, some finds from the sea that even the older merfolk didn't know, and an old family photo book. Fussel woke up. "Oh. Sorry, I didn't mean to wake you up." Fussel made the goat sounds she was known for only a little deeper. She sounded a little annoyed. "I can't sleep. Do you want to play a bit?" Fussel bobbed back and forth a bit. Sammy saw that as yes. "Ok. I'll get some fish quickly."</p>

<p>Sammy snuck past Niki and Ben's room and stopped by the living area. It was all the same as always, just dark. He almost tripped over Fussel's favorite ball. He arrived at the kitchen and took three small fish out of the bucket for Fussel. On the way back to his room, he picked up Fussel's ball.</p>

<p>"So. First tricks, then fish." Sammy looked at Fussel, who was looking longingly at the fish. "Ok, you're allowed to have one." Sammy threw a fish to his seal. Happily, Fussel snapped at the fish and caught it in the air.</p>

<p>Sammy almost threw her a fish for it, but he pulled the ball out instead. "Let's go." Wherever Sammy put the ball, Fussel tried to get in with her nose. She heaved herself diagonally onto Sammy's bed, climbed onto a small stool, and almost knocked over Sammy's table. Sammy threw the second fish to her and watched Fussel happily eat the second fish. Sammy's thoughts overran him again. He sat down next to his bed. "This is it Fussel. Thank you for being here." The last fish was caught by Fussel again without any trick. She laid down on Sammy's legs.</p>

<p>Sammy pulled the pendant off the hook he had attached to his bed especially for it. He looked at the pendant, as he often did when he couldn't fall asleep. Cassaras' bow, a silver thread for Alea, a guitar for Lennox, a ship for Ben, and a clover for Fussel.</p>

<p>He turned the keychain. Tess' harmonica and Hildegard's feather. In addition, for the adventures they had experienced, a pearl, a marble and a fish. Fussel turned on his legs. He started to cuddle her. "Fussel. What am I supposed to do? I'm so confused. This afternoon.... That was so strange. I remember why I didn't want to go. Do you remember when we were in London in the winter? At that time, someone had given me chocolates. We then met in the city and she had tried to kiss me at that time. On the mouth and stuff." Sammy sighed.</p>

<p>Fussel looked at him intently, making soft noises to show Sammy that she was still listening. "At the time, I was too shocked to say or do anything. I didn't tell anyone about it. It would have been strange if they had found out. Today I tried-" He broke off and looked at his watch. "Yesterday I tried to escape this situation, not because I remembered London, but because I just didn't feel like going to the city with her, I think, while Alea and Lennox were with us. But the others had to watch."</p>

<p>He began to tremble. Fussel made goat noises. She tried to calm him down. Sammy pulled his blanket off the bed, but the shaking didn't subside.</p>

<p>"Should we look at the photos again?" Sammy pulled the photo book from his desk. The first photos were with his parents. Sammy had few memories of them, but only good ones. "That's us on the beach of, I think it was Sylt." Sammy showed Fussel the picture of him, Ben, and their mother. Her father had taken the picture.</p>

<p>After a few minutes of looking through the old photo book, Sammy and Fussel came to the photos from 7 years ago when they were out with Alea, Tess and Lennox. "You know Fussel". Sammy paused, reminiscing about Orion and the adventures while looking at the photos, "I miss traveling with everyone."</p>

<p>Of course, he continued to travel with Ben and Niki, but it wasn't the same. "Look, there you are." Sammy showed Fussel a picture of the ringed seal sunbathing. He laughed, and Fussel made the noises that Sammy associated with laughter.</p>

<p>They arrived at the end of the book. The last picture was of Sammy tinkering with the chair that was next to him at the moment. There was a sentence from Ben on the last page. "Stay the way you are!" Sammy smiled.</p>

<p>He slammed the book shut with some force. Fussel was frightened. "Oh, I'm sorry." As an apology, Sammy Fussel gave him a quick pat. He got up and sat down at his desk. "I think I should write some journal. Sometimes, that helps."</p>

<p>His gaze wandered to the unknown objects and on to the magic objects. Among them were a helmet that looked like an astronaut's helmet, three shell books, and a message stone. The helmet was like an air bronn, only mobile. A Kendar boy named Isua had rediscovered blueprints in old documents and developed them further.</p>

<p>He had forgotten that he actually wanted to write a diary. He reached for one of the still unknown objects. It was a jar with a curious shape. It certainly hadn't been used for drinking, as the opening was far too big. Sammy twirled it a little in his hands. It was just a strange-looking glass to him. He put it back on the table. How much he would like to be someone who could figure out what such a glass was used for.</p>

<p>Now he pulled his diary out of the heap. Fussel had laid down next to him. He wrote rather irregularly, because he had most of his knowledge in the adventure diary anyway, but today he felt it was necessary. He wrote for a while about Alea and Lennox's visit and then got to the point of why he wrote in the first place.</p>

<p>
  <em>Was am I doing wrong? Why don't I notice when people like me? At first I thought I was gay, but that doesn't make sense either. I can't imagine that I would notice if a boy liked me. Or I might like a boy. I don't understand it. Fussel is lying right next to me and is sleeping or at least dozing. Sometimes I feel like she can understand me. Not only how an animal can react to people, but my words. We played a bit earlier. Today I really want to go swimming with her. I can see my thoughts just spinning in circles. Now I'm back to the topic of not loving anyone. So I love already, Ben, Fussel, the rest of the Alpha Cru, the sea, magic... But I don't want to imagine going out for a 'romantic' dinner with someone. For others, it's super, great, fantastic. But I just don't want that... It feels so strange. Everyone I know has someone. 16. It also took Ben longer to find someone. Yes...</em>
</p>

<p>Sammy scribbled a small drawing of Fussel in the margin. <em>Was should I do now? Will I be alone forever? Would that be bad? No. I want to have friends. I have friends, but after the reaction today, I'd hate to talk about it with anyone from Alpha Cru. I'm not quite sure they could understand me. Today I still want to try to build the lamp, but I don't know if I have enough energy.</em></p>

<p>That was only a fraction of the thoughts Sammy had during the time he was journaling. He looked at Fussel. She lay peacefully at his feet and seemed to be dozing. She looked very pleased. The shaking started again and Fussel noticed it immediately. She snuggled closer to his legs.</p>

<p>"I... I-" Sammy stuttered, but then broke off. He slid to the floor and pulled Fussel towards him. He started crying. He hadn't cried since they had been tracked by Orion. At that time, it was because of the danger of being caught. Today it was because he didn't know what to do. The stabbing in the chest started again. Fussel pulled the blanket towards them. Sammys sobbed. His mind raced.</p>

<p>He tried to meditate, but that didn't help much. He just couldn't shake the thought that there might be something wrong with him.</p>

<p>Sammy's tears grew more. Fussel also got nervous. She crawled a little closer. Sammy's sobs grew louder. "What am I supposed to do-" He broke off again.</p>

<p>Suddenly, Sammy heard footsteps. It felt like he was being catapulted back to reality. The shaking didn't stop, but Sammy wiped the tears from his face as fast as he could. Someone knocked on the door and Ben came into Sammy's room. He had picked himself up and was now standing with his back to Ben. In the past, he would have told Ben what was going on. Today he was looking for a way out of this situation.</p>

<p>"Sammy? What's going on?" Sammy's mind raced on. His gaze fell on the mobile air bronn. That was probably the only way to escape Ben's questions, at least for a while. "Sam-" Sammy grabbed the air bronn and pushed Ben aside so that it landed on Sammy's bed.</p>

<p>Sammy ran through the ship to the outside. Not a long way, but he could see Ben and Fussel just as he got to the deck. He pulled the air bronn over his head and strapped it tightly. Without thinking much further, he ran to the railing and jumped into the sea.</p>

<p>The Crucis was not directly in front of Kiel, as they had already sailed a bit towards the open sea with Alea and Lennox.</p>

<p>Sammy went into hiding. The sea was as dark as the night above him. Now his thoughts became clearer. He felt for the pendant and tied it to the sweatpants he wore to sleep.</p>

<p>The cold sea around him, the absolute darkness and him. He felt more alert. He heard a splash above him. Ben had also jumped into the water. Fussel followed shortly after. Sammy let himself sink deeper. Ben called out to him, even though he should have known that Sammy hadn't reappeared.</p>

<p>Now Ben dived and continued to search underwater. Fussel swam in circles around Ben. Sammy dove very far down. He was almost at the bottom of the sea. Fussel saw him through her light-sensitive eyes more than Ben. However, when Fussel swam in Sammy's direction, Ben noticed him as well. Ben approached slowly.</p>

<p>Then Fussel arrived at Sammy's side. She offered Sammy to hold on to her. Without hesitation, he pulled himself towards Fussel's fins. As soon as she realized that Sammy was holding on, she swam off. Ben couldn't stand up to a seal.</p>

<p>Without them, Sammy would have been lost. They left Ben behind and swam on the seabed, away from Ben, away from the Crucis, away from thoughts. Sammy watched as Ben swam back to the surface of the water.</p>

<p>It was quiet at the bottom of the sea. At least here. Sammy sat down after they stopped. "Do you think we can go back?" Of course they could go back, Sammy just didn't want to talk to Ben about it.</p>

<p>Fussel nudged him. "Yes, yes, I know." Sammy lay on his back. The sand around him was stired up. "Let's wait until tomorrow." With that, Sammy snuggled up to Fussel and tried not to fall asleep. But also not to stay awake. Was it a good idea to swim away?</p>

<h2> Chapter 3 The Seal Whisperers</h2>
  
<p>Sleeping in an air bronn was not a good idea. Depending on how many air batteries they had, you had to be careful not to drain them too quickly. Replenishing stationary air bronns was a task of the seal whisperers, as the seals used them the most.</p>

<p>Sammy had asked Alea to give him all the book clams about seals and seal whisperers. He didn't know much Hajara at the time, but he wanted to read all about seal whisperers and also take precautions in case something was wrong with Fussel. By now, he knew most of his shell collection by heart.</p>

<p>So Sammy and Fussel dozed off until the early hours of the morning. At least that was what Sammy hoped for. It was very difficult to see if it was day or night. "What should we do now? I'd like to collect some shells." Sammy was really lucky that his pyjamas had pockets.</p>

<p>Fussel spun in the water. "Good, let's go!" Fussel kicked up some sand and floated up a bit. "You need air, don't you? Then let's swim up for a moment." Sammy swam up to Fussel, who pulled him to the surface.</p>

<p>It was only when Sammy swam up that he saw how beautiful the area was. A bit colorless, but some rocks seemed to stand in special formations. One looked like a star, others were just lines. He could see a huge rock on the horizon, but he was too far away to see the details.</p>

<p>Once on the surface, Sammy pulled off the air bronn. He let it float on the water in such a way that it automatically filled with air again. Meanwhile, Fussel swam in circles around him. They were already quite far from the coast. The Crucis did not leave the place where it had stood yesterday. Hopefully, Ben hadn't been looking for him all night. The sun was just rising.</p>

<p>Suddenly, another seal appeared next to Fussel. And another. Then a human head came out of the water. Sammy hadn't really paid attention to what was happening underneath him and was startled. "Hello?" he asked in Hajara. "Oh yes, hello." A sea person with dark hair tied up in a practical bun swam in front of him. They seemed a little confused.</p>

<p>"My name is Twan. Are you half a sea person? You speak Hajara pretty well, but you have an accent" That was pretty direct. Sammy pulled Fussel towards him. "No, I'm a land walker. I learned Hajara from..." He paused for a moment and wondered if he should tell that he had travelled with Alea. Most merfolk then only asked him about his time with Alea. "... my brother." This was not a lie. Ben had taught him a lot. "My name is Sammy." Twan nodded. "Cool."</p>

<p>It became uncomfortably quiet for a moment. The seals swam around them. Sammy glanced at them for a moment. "And the seals? Do they belong to you?" Sammy noticed that some of them were carrying some kind of scaffolding. Twan stroked a seal swimming by. "Yes. I have been taking care of the seals with my friends for two years. This one's called Ruby."</p>

<p>Now Sammy was getting excited. "You're a seal whisperer? I've read a lot of books about you. But of course, I only have a fraction of the knowledge you have. Can you teach me?" Sammy was talking faster and faster. "Can you take me with you? I want to know everything you know!" Twan laughed and replied, "Ok, ok. Come on down. Maybe I should introduce you to the others first. Can you swim with-" Twan points to Fussel. Sammy nodded. "She's called Fussel." Sammy nudged her. "Can we go?" It pulled up the air bronn again.</p>

<p>Twan laughed, dove under, and shouted, "If you can keep up!" Sammy smiled too and dove under. Fussel offered him one of her fins, which he accepted. Twan shot away. The seals followed. Sammy didn't stand a chance. He was just half as fast as Twan. Sammy noticed that they were swimming towards the big rock he had seen before.</p>

<p>Pictures and clues were painted large on the stone. In Hajara on the rock, it said in red: "Headquarters of the Baltic Sea Seal Whisperers" Sammy and Fussel came closer. Twan and the rest of the seals were already waiting. "Well. We still have to practice that. Later. Come in first." The rock had a hole in the side. There was a kind of curtain in grey, it already looked a bit worn, which hung in front of it.</p>

<p>Someone called from inside. "Twan, is that you? Can you please come in and help? The food for the seals still needs to be prepared." Twan rolled his eyes. "In a sec. I brought someone with me. We'll bring the seals into the rock. Come on, Sammy." Twan dragged Sammy and Fussel to another rock. This one had a smaller entrance, the seals swam into it automatically.</p>

<p>"Can Fussel get in there, too?" "Sure, if she wants to. Some seals live in this or one of the other caves, they are all connected, but some like us so much that they prefer to stay with us all the time", two seals stayed with Sammy and Twan, "This is Blueberry and this is Lily. Emmy chose the names."</p>

<p>Then someone appeared behind them. "Twan, then introduce me to our guest before you just swim away again. Twan made a "humpf" sound. "I'm Sammy. Hi. This is Fussel." In front of them was a sea person just the size of Sammy. He wore a green flex with an extraordinary number of pockets. "Fine, I already knew your name. I'm Neom. I take care of the food and food for the seals, because someone has to do that. How long do you plan to stay?"</p>

<p>He had a serious face, and his personality seemed similar. Quite a lot of planning... Twan replied for Sammy, "We don't know yet. He wants to learn a little bit about the job of seal whisperers."</p>

<p>Neom nodded briefly but looked sceptical. "Can you help with the cooking? We have a Schai, a Zalti, two whalewalkers and me, I'm a Kendarer, not a Hoa, but I can remember recipes well. At least it's better than studying book shells all day and then not being allowed to do anything with them."</p>

<p>"I'm hungry," Twan chimed in, while Blueberry and Lily swam around Sammy, sniffing him. At least that's what it looked like. "Then come. There's Nayoa and seaweed, but first we have to feed the seals." Neom swam ahead. Sammy and Twan followed more slowly. "Twan, get the others. Sammy can feed the seals. Remember that we will soon have to renew the air in Seal Rock." "Remembering is your thing," Twan said with a roll of his eyes and swam away with Blueberry. Neom nodded in the direction of a rock.</p>

<p>"How can you speak Hajara so well? You're a land walker, aren't you?" Sammy nodded. "I'll tell you about that later, I can imagine that the others will have exactly the same questions. Who still lives here?" Sammy looked around a bit. They were getting closer and closer to the huge rock.</p>

<p>"Emmy, Jusou, Gewa, Twan, the seals and me. Emmy and Gewa are the whalewalkers, they live here because Emmy once got into a whale frenzy and no one could help her until she flew off the whale after three days. After that, her mother decided that she couldn't go on Trosk again. Gewa is her brother, he joined voluntarily to take care of Emmy."</p>

<p>They arrived inside "Welcome. This is the lounge, the dining room or the living room." It was a large, lit room with more pictures on the walls. Sammy was finally able to get a better look. There were a lot of pictures of seals in different colors. Some realistic, others in a cartoonish style. Sammy was intrigued.</p>

<p>Twan came through the entrance. "Emmy and Jusou are coming soon, Gewa needs a little more time until he is here, he is still sleeping." Sammy swam to the walls and continued to look at the details. Some pictures also showed the scaffolding that some seals had carried earlier. "I've never read anything about the racks that some of your seals are wearing. They're not leading racks, so what then?"</p>

<p>A sea person with an extraordinarily wide flex came in through the door behind Twan. "These are speed racks. Made for seal racing." There was a short awkward pause, "Who are you?" Sammy didn't elaborate on the question. "How cool! Are you doing seal races here? Did they exist before the virus existed? Who makes the racks for you?" "This is Sammy. I found it today in the morning routine. He'd like to know more about seal whisperers." Twan answered for Sammy, "But first, I want to have some breakfast. Sammy, that's Jusou, the Schai."</p>

<p>Jusou waved at Sammy. Neom was in the process of filling a kind of sealed bowl. "This is Sammy. Bring this to the seals. This is fish sauce with slices. We feed it a lot because it has everything seals need." The pot was very large, but since they were in the sea, it was easier for Sammy to transport it. "Then come on Fussel, let's bring it to your fellows." Sammy grabbed the pot under one arm and grabbed Fussel on the other.</p>

<p>Fussel pulled him to the seal rock and then inside. Inside there was an air dome. The seals were all close to each other. Sammy lifted the pot out of the water and looked around. There was a pit in which the food seemed to have been placed. There were still leftovers from yesterday's dinner. Sammy tipped the pot in. Fussel rolled up to the other seals. "You want to eat here? See you later." Sammy waved to Fussel before getting back into the water and submerging.</p>

<p>Back with the others, Sammy noticed that it would be hard for him to eat. Neom was pouring what looked like tomato soup into sealed jars. The others sat around a deep table. Sammy noticed that another sea person was sitting next to them.</p>

<p>That had to be Emmy. On her lap lay a seal that Emmy was petting. "Hi! I'm Sammy," he introduced himself. "Hi." She continued to pet her seal. "What's your seal's name?" "Quibble." Twan chimed in, "She doesn't talk very much," Emmy gave Twan an annoyed look, "or likes to."</p>

<p>Someone came swimming through the door. "Morning Neom. Morning guys." Tired, the sea person, he had to be Gewa, swam over to Neom and kissed him. Neom rolled his eyes. "Don't pretend, I know you like that. Shall I quote you?" Neom rolled his eyes again. "Good morning back. You really that took your time." Gewa looked at Twan. "Yes, I know, I like to sleep in", only now did he seem to notice that Sammy was there too, "Who is that?" "Hi, I'm Sammy. I want to learn what it's like to be a seal whisperer."</p>

<p>Gewa smiled and said, "Ah. The last time I heard that sentence was when Jusou showed up at our door one day. That was about a year ago now. Now we know that this was just an excuse." Jusou looked at him laughing and answered, "I know, but I didn't lie then. I love seals and wanted to know what it's like to take care of them. But I'm mostly writing a book where I compare what it's like to be a seal whisperer before and after the virus," he said to Sammy. "How cool. Can I read it later?"</p>

<p>Jusou stood up excitedly. "Absolutely, do you want to see my collection of book shells? Each one has its own story, how I got it!" Sammy was also getting more and more excited. They were getting louder and louder. Emmy withdrew a bit. "Please! I also have a collection of book clams about seal whisperers!"</p>

<p>Sammy realized he didn't have them right now. They were on the Crucis and Ben was there. He dropped sadly to the floor. "You have to lend them to me!" Sammy shook his head sadly. "I don't have them with me right now. They are with my brother on our boat. I can't go there at the moment." Now Twan became interested, "the brother who taught you Hajara? Why doesn't he live in the sea?"</p>

<p>Sammy shook his head. "So yes and no. Ben is also a land walker. He actually lives on the boat with his girlfriend and me. But I ran away yesterday, or rather today, because I..." He broke off. "I had assumed he was a sea person and your adopted brother. Interesting. Why does he know Hajara? Is his girlfriend a sea person?"</p>

<p>Fortunately, Twan didn't go into the reason why he ran away. "We used to travel with some sea people." Sammy didn't say anything about Alea and Lennox directly yet because he didn't want the conversation to be all about them. "I was 9 at the time and already knew a few other languages, but somehow I didn't get the chance to learn Hajara. I started later, that was in the same year, only in the winter."</p>

<p>"The food is ready!" Neom distributed containers of red soup. "Here's another straw, Sammy. It's a bit hard to eat with an air bronn." Sammy stuffed the straw under the air bron. "How did you all meet?", Sammy wondered, "I know that Emmy and Gewa are siblings and that Jusou apparently wanted to be a seal whisperer, but what about you Twan?"</p>

<p>Twan smiled. "I grew up with Neom. We were in the same adoptive family. He was the one who always warned me not to go swimming in the sea or running in the rain. Otherwise, I'm sure I would have died long ago. Neom and Gewa knew each other before the virus and were already friends back then. Gewa and Emmy's mother brought them ashore just before the virus broke out."</p>

<p>Gewa picked up where Twan had left off, "She had fallen in love with a land walker who lived very far inland. Our father died of poisoning shortly after Emmy was born. After the virus broke out, our mother became paranoid and we were not allowed to leave the house. But we were wanderers, we found our way out of the house and explored the area, a little more each day. When the virus was defeated, we were officially allowed to leave the house for the first time and we went on holiday by the sea. To sum up the rest, the two of us have been living in the sea ever since."</p>

<p>Sammy listened intently, almost forgetting that he was supposed to eat. "Can you show me what they do in seal races?" He wanted to try it out with Fussel as well. Twan nodded, "Sure. Then we're going to do a race today. But you still need a harness for Fussel and we'll have to see if Fussel wants to swim at all."</p>

<p>Twan put down his bottle. "Right now?" "Who's going to clean up today?" "Emmy can do that, she'll never comes with anyway." "No." "Don't push all the tasks to Emmy." Sammy liked the mess, unlike lately at home. It reminded him of the trip. He reached for his keychain.</p>

<p>"The first thing you should know is the track we always used. Come with me." Twan reached out to Sammy. He held on tight. They swam to the top for a while. "I hope you see the different stones around here. They mark important points. This is where we start." Twan pointed to a rock near the main rock.</p>

<p>They went through the track once and then swam back down, towards another rock. "Now let's find a suitable frame. This is our shed." It was another rock with a larger entrance than the other rocks." Gewa wanted to get the robes. They should be here soon." Twan pulled a rack from a stone shelf. "This should fit. The majority of seals keep the scaffolds on most of the time, as they don't bother much because they are very light."</p>

<p>Sammy listened intently. "If a seal is injured, we'll take it to Emmy. She takes care of the injured and sick seals. She knows a lot about medicine."</p>

<p>Gewa came in with Fussel, Lily, Blueberry and another seal. The other three already had their scaffolding on. The rack was also offered to Fussel and she circled it a few times until she decided it was no danger. "Then let's get you dressed." Gewa stroked Fussel and put the harness over Fussel's head. It seemed to fit. "Perfect. Sammy, you've got to get your feet in here and hold on here." Twan showed Sammy how to hold on tight and went onto Blueberry. It was quite simple. "Exactly! Then we can go now." The rack didn't seem to bother Fussel.</p>

<p>They came to the starting line and Gewa, Jusou and Neom also climbed on their seals. "Let's see how fast you are now," Twan said with an amused expression on his face. "That's mean, I'd be faster if I was a sea person and could practice regularly!" said Sammy, laughing.</p>

<p>"Would you like to be a sea person?" asked Jusou. Sammy had asked himself this question often enough. "Yes! I'd love to be a sea person." "We could put you on the list." Sammy looked at the others. Neom rolled his eyes, "Can't we talk about it later? I thought we were going to race?"</p>

<p>Jusou turns and his seal forward. "Sure. Who wants to give the signal?" Sammy was still wondering what the list meant. "I'll do it." Neom swam to what looked like an algae with a stone tied to it. Neom snapped it back and quickly swam back to her place. After about 5 seconds, the algae crashed back into its original position and hit a rock, it made a dull sound and Sammy took that as the signal to swim. He signalled to Fussel with his hand and Fussel shot off.</p>

<p>Twan and Neom quickly took the lead, and Gewa joined Sammy. "Try to push yourself down a little more." With that, he also swam further forward. Jusou also overtook him, but only halfway through. As Sammy and Fussel swam around the final corner, Sammy saw that Twan seemed to have won.</p>

<p>"But that was much better than this morning!" Twan approached him. "We're taking a little break now to give the seals a break. In the meantime, I can show you what racks we still have for the seals." Sammy pulled away from Fussel and waved at her. She had done her best. Neom just gave the seals fish and threw some to Fussel. Sammy followed Twan slowly. "What is meant by 'the list'?" The question had been burning on his tongue the whole race.</p>

<p>"Jusou is referring to the list of the Lafora. Jusou is on the list because he's looking for someone to swap sex characteristics with him, but there are also people who would like to belong to another tribe, or people who would like to be sea people."</p>

<p>Tess had to be on the list too. It was weird that Sammy hadn't heard of it before. "Can you put me on the list?" "Of course we can. All we need is a Gilf. But you should think again. It's just not possible for you to become a land walker again." He would put up with this in order to learn even more about merfolk and their abilities.</p>

<p>They arrived at the shed. "This is a classic merchant's rack that is mostly used by Lorka. It's still a bit lighter than the racing frames." Twan handed the frame to Sammy. It was indeed lighter. Twan pulled another rack from the shelf. "We only needed this when a seal broke its back. It's not a nice thing." The harness had extra padding. "Where did you get all the racks?" "We usually get it from the nearest sea town, Obel Tatun. It's about half a day's journey from here." Sammy nodded.</p>

<p>Twan thought aloud, "Do we have any other racks I could show you? No, I think that's all we have. I'm sure there are a few other special ones, but that's all we have ever needed." Sammy nodded and put the merchant rack back on the shelf. "Shall we swim back?" Twan nodded and grinned, "the others had enough rest."</p>

<p>Back with Gewa, Jusou and Neom, Sammy sat down on the bottom of the ocean. "Swimming all day without webbed feet is really exhausting." Sammy would guess it was already afternoon, if not later. The sun was hard to see. He had already gotten little sleep. "Do we want to swim the big lap now?", Twan sat down on Blueberry again.</p>

<p>Neom shook his head. "I don't know if we have enough time. It's almost night, and Sammy hadn't better sleep underwater." Sammy realized that he had better stay with the seal whisperers, because he had no idea where else to sleep. "No, that's not a problem, I can just sleep with the seals. I... But then I would need a flex because it would certainly get cold quickly in my pyjamas."</p>

<p>Neom tilted his head to the side. "Are you sure? Don't you want to go back to your brother?" Sammy looked down. At some point, he had to tell what had happened. "We argued, no, that's wrong. I ran away. It's a long story. Maybe I'll tell it another time... Can you please let me sleep with the seals just for tonight?"</p>

<p>Neom shook his head. "Sammy, you need to tell us what happened. I'm pretty sure that will help. Maybe we'll find a way to support you. Come on, let's swim back. I'll get you an old Flex from Tvan first."</p>

<p>Back in the room where they had eaten before, in a well-fitting flex, Sammy sat on the floor. The others, and even Emmy, sat next to him. Fussel was on Sammy's feet. Sammy told them about his afternoon yesterday, then how he couldn't fall asleep and that he misses his friends.</p>

<p>He held the pendant in his fingers. "I just want us to be able to sail the sea together again. But that doesn't work. I didn't just learn from my brother Hajara. It was mostly Alea Aquarius who taught me. But Snow White and Scorpio don't have much time, they have to rebuild the sea world..." Emmy listened. "You travelled with Alea Aquarius?" Sammy nodded.</p>

<p>"How is she in person?" Twan looked more attentive now. "She's super nice. I'm sure she'd love to meet you when she has time. But can I stay for the night now?" Neom nodded. "Today you can stay, but tomorrow you have to talk to Ben. I'm pretty sure he'll understand you." The words relieved Sammy quite a bit. Jusou seemed to think of something: "Do you want to be put on the list?" Sammy nodded, "If you could do that... But it certainly takes a long time to find a merfolk who wants to trade."</p>

<p>Neom replied for Jusou, "No, not really. Especially after it became known that Laforas can switch between sea people and land walkers, especially younger sea people have chosen to stay with their adoptive families, or for older ones it may be a reason that they want to live on land with their partner or some just don't necessarily want to be sea people."</p>

<p>It was quiet for a while. "Would you put me on the list then?" Gewa nodded, "You'd better discuss this with Ben and Niki first too." Gewa patted Sammy on the back. "Come on, it's already late for today. Let's go to sleep."</p>

<p>Sammy had been given some kind of pillow made of seaweed and a blanket. The blanket was crocheted and probably came from a land walker, he didn't know if sea people could crochet. He laid down the blanket as a base, the pillow on a stone to get a little extra height. It was cold, but the flex regulated its temperature. Just before he went to sleep, Twan came to him again. "I'll just fill up the air, it won't take long, but we don't want you or the seals to suffocate." Twan smiled at Sammy. Sammy nodded.</p>

<p>A few minutes later, that too was done. Sammy lay down on his bed. "Good night then, see you tomorrow." Twan swam out of the cave. Fussel snuggled up to Sammy and fell asleep right away. Sammy fell asleep as soon as he realized that Fussel had also fallen asleep.</p>

<h2> Chapter 4 Dragons and Cakes</h2>
  
<p>Sammy woke up when he heard voices coming from the direction of the entrance. He stood up and felt for the pendant in the pocket of his flex. Next, he pulled the air bronn over his head again. Twan appeared. "Sammy! Good. You're awake. Come out, please." So Sammy came out. Fussel followed him.</p>

<p>Alea was waiting in front of the rock, a Finja was just swimming away. Alea looked very relieved. Sammy faltered. "Hi Sammy. We were so worried, why did you run away?" "Uh so..." Sammy lowered himself slightly towards the bottom of the sea. Neom, who was also standing with Alea, swam to him. "Come on Sammy, you said yesterday you were going to tell Ben about it today. Why don't you tell Alea?"</p>

<p>Sammy shook his head vigorously. "Maybe later. Can we wait until tonight? I want to spend some more time with the seal whisperers." Twan shook his head. "You're just putting it off."</p>

<p>Twan was right. Neom was right, too. He put it off, but it would all be fine. "Good, let's go then." Sammy swam to Alea. "I'll tell you at the Crucis. Twan, do you want the Flex back? Ah, and what about the frame of Fussel?" Neom shook his head, "You can keep both of these as a memory. Of course, I hope you'll come and visit us."</p>

<p>Sammy smiled. "Thank you," he looked at the floor, "Are the others awake yet?" As if at a signal, Jusou swam towards the seal rock. "I'm sure Gewa is still asleep, Emmy doesn't want to be disturbed when she's in her room," Neom said. Can't we wait for them? You'll have to feed the seals right away. I can still help!" "I'm sure Emmy and Gewa are making an exception today. Wait here." Jusou swam off.</p>

<p>"Do you think Emmy thinks it's okay too? I mean, she was pretty cool when we talked." Sammy rubbed his hands nervously. Twan nodded and said, "Yes, she's not really happy here. She likes the seals very much, but she would much rather go to Trosk. Her mother, however, is, well, very worried about Emmy. When she's old enough, she'll probably leave us." Sammy thought for a moment. He misses his parents very often. His parents wouldn't have been like that, would they?</p>

<p>Sammy came back to the present when Alea started talking to Twan. She asked if they would organize a local seal race. They engaged in a conversation about the opportunities they had. Gewa swam up. "Sammy's leaving?" Sammy nodded.</p>

<p>"Alea? Alea Aquarius?" Emmy, Emmy's seal, and Twan swam up. Alea smiled. "Good morning." Emmy let her seal pull her around the group. "Emmy, Sammy has to leave, Alea is here to pick him up." Sammy looked down. "Do I really have to? I like it here."</p>

<p>Alea nodded slowly. "Ben is really worried. The sooner we get back, the better. He contacted me when we were almost in Obel Tatun. I came back as fast as I could." Sammy continued to look at the ground. "I'm sorry. I didn't want to take your vacation away... I really should go now, right?"</p>

<p>Sammy looked at the seal whisperers. "Can I still have a hug?" The others swam up to him and hugged him. Emmy hesitated for a moment. Twan was the first to break away, "You are always welcome with us. Promise you will visit, will you?" Sammy and the others broke away as well. Sammy nodded and smiled. Twan grinned back.</p>

<p>"I think we can go." Alea nodded. Sammy got on Fussel and they swam off. As Alea and Sammy moved farther away from the rocks, Sammy looked back and waved to Twan, Neom, and Jusou.</p>

<p>Sammy could see the Crucis getting bigger the closer they got. The ship had barely moved since yesterday. Sammy climbed onto the deck. Ben was waiting. Sammy silently fetched Fussel on deck as well. Ben watched him. Alea also came to the deck.</p>

<p>"Sammy, why did you run away?" Sammy paused. He'd said he'd tell Ben. "The day before yesterday. Because of the day before yesterday." "Come in first. Alea, thank you for bringing him back, do you want to stay a little longer?" Alea shook her head. "I want to get back to Lennox as soon as possible. Whatever you have to tell, Sammy, you can do it. Tell me when we visit again."</p>

<p>"Thanks again for bringing me back." Sammy waved goodbye to Alea.</p>

<p>On the sofa table was a glass with a bottle of apple juice. Sammy sat down and Ben poured him some apple juice before sitting down next to Sammy. "So?"</p>

<p>So Sammy told him what he had been thinking the day before yesterday. That he doesn't know what her parents would think of him if they were still alive. That he loved all his friends, but never found anyone really attractive.</p>

<p>He was still nervous, but he was shaking less now. Fussel was snuggled against his feet. "That's why you ran away? Oh, Draco." Ben pulled him into a hug. "Please don't just run away in the middle of the night again, will you?" Sammy nodded. He was relieved that Ben responded so well. "Promised?" "That's a promise!"</p>

<p>Niki came out of the bathroom, saw Sammy, and walked up to her. "Sammy, you're back! Is everything ok?" "Yes, yes. I think I want to make a adventure diary entry first. I've met Seal Whisperers underwater!" "Can we listen?" Sammy thought for a moment, but then nodded. He jumped up and took his cell phone out of his cabin.</p>

<p>Back on the sofa, Sammy finally took a sip of the apple juice. Sammy started recording. "Sammy's Adventure Journal, 22 July, 7 years after Orion, entry 2023."</p>

<p>He talked about the seal whisperers, the things he had learned about the sea world, the list, the seals, the rocks they lived in, and the seal races. "I also got on the list, I'd like to be a sea person."</p>

<p>Ben tapped him. Sammy nodded. "Are you sure? I mean, that's something you can't undo." "I've thought about it for a long time, but I think I'd be happy as a sea person. I want to be a seal whisperer." Ben nodded. "If that's what you want, then do it." Sammy smiled happily at him.</p>

<p>The day was quiet. They wanted to continue sailing tomorrow and had set the autopilot. Sammy sat on the deck and looked at the sea, Fussel was looking for food. Niki came to him. "Do we want to bake chocolate cake? I'm in the mood for chocolate cake." Sammy definitely wanted to. "Sure!" Sammy ran ahead to the kitchen corner. Niki followed him slowly. Sammy got all the ingredients and Niki took out bowls and spoons.</p>

<p>Ben, Niki and Sammy sat on the deck and ate chocolate cake. Fussel sunbathed. Sammy thought about what he had experienced in the last few days and that it wasn't so bad that he didn't have to be with anyone, he still loved his friends.</p>
