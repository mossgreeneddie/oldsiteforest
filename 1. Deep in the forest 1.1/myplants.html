        <h1>Meet my Plants</h1>
        <h2>Barthel</h2>
        <h3>Dracaena braunii</h3>
        <div class="plant">
            <img src="https://files.catbox.moe/6ace35.png"></div>
            <p>The first one I got. They are a present form a friend of my for a birthday a few years ago. They need to be repodded soon.</p>

        <h2>Günter</h2>
        <h3>Chlorophytum comosum</h3>
        <div class="plant">
            <img src="https://files.catbox.moe/9y49jx.png"></div>
            <p>They were my second plant. I dont quite remember where they came from but I think they were a present for my "Konfirmation" (Sth like a second baptising). I am no longer religous and the day I got them was the worst one of my life. I still love them.</p>

        <h2>Herbert</h2>
        <h3>Haworthia fasciata</h3>
        <div class="plant">
            <img src="https://files.catbox.moe/xqehkr.png"></div>
            <p>I got him from my mum. He lived in our kitchen but we got our cats and they bit the kaktie. So they moved to the "Abstellkammer". This is funny in German because there is where all our video games are but translated the word means storage room.</p>
            
    
        <h2>Bill</h2>
        <h3>Chamaedorea elegans</h3>
        <div class="plant">
            <img src="https://files.catbox.moe/2cb9xd.png"></div>
            <p>Two of my aunts (siblings) celebrated their birthday together. I was there too and I helped with decoration and setting some things up. I asked what would happen with the plants. They said they didn't know and that I could take one with me. Newest additon to the team.</p>
