    <h2>My dear,</h2>
    <p>i see you have been dreaming a lot. Any idea of how to show me?<br> I draw a lot, I paint a lot. Mostof my art is digital. I dont know if i will ever show the internet. I like my art. I know I can still learn a lot but i have been getting there. Doing this. Just doing.</p>
    <p>I dont think you can be bad at drawing. At creating.</p>
    <p>I have been quite happy. I escape when I need to. Spend a lot of time in this world. I can't describe it with words. I can only love the colors, the shapes.</p>
